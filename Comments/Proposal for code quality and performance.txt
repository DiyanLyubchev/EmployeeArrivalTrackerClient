Into project Json Employee Generator changes, that I can improve are:

1. The variables roles and teams I would make const and add them to nomenclature class
2. The logic, that read from file employee.txt, I would exported to ReadFile Service
3. The logic, that write List<JsonEmployee> into employees.json, I would exported to WriteFile Service and use JsonSerializer library.
   First to serialize object and second use write all text method for create and fill json.
4. The object JsonEmployee, I  would move to project or folder model.
