Before you start projects, you need to exsecute two commands for seed data.
Into package manager console changed default project to EmployeeArrivalTrackerDataAccess and run
   1. Add-Migration Initial
   2. Update-Database

There are two projects WebApplication and EmployeeArrivalTrackerClient.
First you must run WebApplication and next EmployeeArrivalTrackerClient, because EmployeeArrivalTrackerClient has hosted service, 
wich calls WebApplication once on 12 hours after it is started.
